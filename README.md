configs
=======

Introduction
------

This repo is meant to be of help to those who have problems configuring their own look. Trying some different approaches and learning on mistakes of the others I find those files useful enough to be shared.

Comments
------

Before loading those configuration files please make sure you have font files, libraries etc. that are needed by them - the owners put so much work into those that I think you really should visit their repos/homepages/etc.
Thank you very much in advance.

Lastly
------

If you want to change something or you found a strange bug, feel free to contribute. Fork option is here for you!
